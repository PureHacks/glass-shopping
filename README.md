glass-shopping
==============

Shopping app for Google glass using the Mirror API, build on the Mean (actually Men, since there is no Angular :P) stack.

It allows the user to create a shopping list for several shops via a web interface and notifies the user with a customized shopping list when she/he's close to a store.

*This is still only a prototype, functional but very crude.*
